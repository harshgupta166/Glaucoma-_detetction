# Glaucoma Detection System

Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of glaucoma, a progressive eye disease that can lead to permanent blindness if untreated. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze retinal fundus images and classify them as either glaucoma-positive or negative.

Features
Automated Detection: Identifies potential glaucoma cases from fundus images.
High Accuracy: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for doctors and researchers.
Data Visualization: Displays heatmaps highlighting areas of concern in the retina.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
OpenCV (Image Processing)
NumPy and Pandas (Data Handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
Dataset: Publicly available glaucoma datasets (e.g., REFUGE, ORIGA).
